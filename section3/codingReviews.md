### **Task Description**  
    The objective of code review is for software developers to identify and fix bugs before the code is released to the public. 
    However, code review can do more than just resolve problems; it can also enhance code quality, reduce reliance on QA, save money, 
    and boost engineering development and knowledge exchange in general. For software development teams, code reviews are a widely regarded best practice. 
    This article goes through why the most successful teams employ code reviews and how to include them into your development process.

### Part 1: A Complete Guide to Code Reviews[^1]

#### **The Four Whys of Code Reviews**
    The following are the objectives of code reviews:
    - Sharing knowledge -- The quantity of knowledge supplied depends on how comprehensive the review is, but some knowledge will always be sent along. 
      The knowledge could be general information about the framework or programming language, or it could be really useful domain-specific data.
    - Spreading ownership -- Mutual code ownership improves as a result of code reviews. It's easy to get into a scenario where one developer is always 
      dealing with a specific portion of the codebase since that's where they're most comfortable. It may be a short-term victory, but it is frequently a long-term loss. 
      Teams become more determined and independent when ownership is shared.
    - Unifying development practices -- Every programmer has their own preferences and methods for implementing software. Code reviews reduce the barriers between different
      development techniques and unify the codebase. High-level conversations regarding architecture and software design, as well as micro-level continuous integration checks 
      like coding style enforcement, lead to unification.
    - Quality control -- Code reviews have been demonstrated in studies to assist in the detection of flaws, but they also disclose software design concerns while they are nevertheless 
      reasonably easy to modify.

#### **Adopting Code Reviews** 
    - Setting up the review process correctly is critical. Code reviews at their worst, may appear to be a stumbling block. Code reviews, at their best, aid in the long-term maintenance 
      of a solid, steady team performance.
    - If your company is unfamiliar with code reviews, implementing them will be a significant shift in the development process. When making changes to how people work, it's a great idea 
      to check that everyone is on board with the procedure and has had an opportunity to weigh in on the choice. There will be less friction as a result of this.
    - When it comes to peers providing comments on one other's work, social interactions must be considered. It's a tough job that necessitates everyone's participation. 
      Make sure to properly consult and educate your staff on communication methods to maximize the chances of success.
