### **Task Description**  
    The objective of code review is for software developers to identify and fix bugs before the code is released to the public. 
    However, code review can do more than just resolve problems; it can also enhance code quality, reduce reliance on QA, save money, 
    and boost engineering development and knowledge exchange in general. For software development teams, code reviews are a widely regarded best practice. 
    This article goes through why the most successful teams employ code reviews and how to include them into your development process.


### Part 1: A Complete Guide to Code Reviews[^1]

#### **The Four Whys of Code Reviews**

    The following are the objectives of code reviews:
    - Sharing knowledge -- The quantity of knowledge supplied depends on how comprehensive the review is, but some knowledge will always be sent along. 
      The knowledge could be general information about the framework or programming language, or it could be really useful domain-specific data.
    - Spreading ownership -- Mutual code ownership improves as a result of code reviews. It's easy to get into a scenario where one developer is always 
      dealing with a specific portion of the codebase since that's where they're most comfortable. It may be a short-term victory, but it is frequently a long-term loss. 
      Teams become more determined and independent when ownership is shared.
    - Unifying development practices -- Every programmer has their own preferences and methods for implementing software. Code reviews reduce the barriers between different
      development techniques and unify the codebase. High-level conversations regarding architecture and software design, as well as micro-level continuous integration checks 
      like coding style enforcement, lead to unification.
    - Quality control -- Code reviews have been demonstrated in studies to assist in the detection of flaws, but they also disclose software design concerns while they are nevertheless 
      reasonably easy to modify.

#### **Adopting Code Reviews** 

    - Setting up the review process correctly is critical. Code reviews at their worst, may appear to be a stumbling block. Code reviews, at their best, aid in the long-term maintenance 
      of a solid, steady team performance.
    - If your company is unfamiliar with code reviews, implementing them will be a significant shift in the development process. When making changes to how people work, it's a great idea 
      to check that everyone is on board with the procedure and has had an opportunity to weigh in on the choice. There will be less friction as a result of this.
    - When it comes to peers providing comments on one other's work, social interactions must be considered. It's a tough job that necessitates everyone's participation. 
      Make sure to properly consult and educate your staff on communication methods to maximize the chances of success.


### Part 2: Understanding Code Review and its Benefits[^2]
      
#### **Benefits of Code Review**

    - Ensures consistency in design and implementation -- Every programmer has his or her own programming style. In large projects, it goes without saying that numerous developers are 
      involved. When developers stick to their own coding styles throughout development, communication degrades and progress is slowed down. Code review is beneficial in the long run since 
      project team members change. Maintaining a constant coding approach will also allow future developers to spend less time evaluating old code and more time implementing new features.
    - Collaborating and share new techniques -- Code review not only saves time and money, but it also provides a human-centric return on investment. While coding, programmers spend the
      majority of their time alone. Code review, on the other hand, encourages developer collaboration. This enables developers to talk about their code and share their ideas with one 
      another. Also, it promotes mutual trust among the programmers. Moreover, during code review, team members can share information about new learnings. This allows team members to 
      improve their abilities by learning about new technology.
    - Monitoring project quality and requirements -- Any project has a clear scope and set of requirements. A complex project entails the collaboration of multiple developers.
      According to the specifications, each developer builds unique features. However, there's a high risk that a developer will misunderstand a requirement and design a pointless feature. Code review aids in the resolution of such issues since it compares the developed feature to the expected feature. This acts as a check for the features that have been developed. This means that any misunderstandings about the scope or needs be addressed as soon as possible. This also ensures that teams aren't losing out on important features.
    - Optimizing code for better performance -- Whenever it comes to code optimization, code review assists younger developers in identifying areas for improvement. Because they lack the 
      necessary knowledge, younger developers are ignorant of various code optimization strategies that can assist them in writing clean code. The code review process allows them to get
      valuable input from senior engineers and, as a result, improve their coding skills. It also aids in the detection of important faults or blunders that can lead to serious issues.
      By allowing a second set of eyes to analyze each code unit, code review aids in the elimination of errors before moving on to the following phase. If there are any errors, the
      reviewer double-checks them and fixes them.
   

### Part 3: Best Practices for Code Review[^3]

#### **9 Best Practices for Code Review**

      The following are some of the best techniques for code review:
    - 1. Understand what to look for when conducting a code review
    - 2. Prior to review, create and test
    - 3. Promote a positive work environment
    - 4. Don't spend more than 60 minutes reviewing the code
    - 5. Save time by automating
    - 6. Provide constructive feedback
    - 7. Don't check more than 400 lines at once
    - 8. Include all in the code review process
    - 9. Make goals and expectations clear


### Part 4: How to Improve Code Reviews[^4]
- Tone: Understand that the person who wrote the code put time and effort into doing so and reflect that in your response. Use constructive critcism and be empathetic when writing a code review. Offer alternatives instead of demanding that it be completely changed. Ask inviting questions to try andunderstand the process of what's happening in the code or why a certain thing was done.
- Changes: Don't approve changes if you still have unanswered questions. Make it clear what changes should be changed and what changes are approved.
- Communication: Leave however many comments or questions you have so you can understand. However try and avoid having back and forth conversations in the comments. As a code reviewer do not hesitate to reach out to the person if there is a lot of comments and questions and progress is not being made from discussing them in the code review. This saves a lot of time and misunderstanding. 
- Location: If the perople are located in different offices or time zones it's very important to be aware of this. Try and make code reviews during the overlapping time between timezones so there is less of a wait between change. If a review requires a lot of comments and questions, as stated before it may be easier to reach out for a call or message them directly.
