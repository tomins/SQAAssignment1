    - [x] Come up with tasks to be done and test branch, merge etc

#### Step 2: Setup each sub-file for each section of the report
- [x] Tami is going to create three folders, one for each of the questions in the assignment
- [x] Then going to merge this to the main branch
- [x] Then go into each folder and create the .md file to be used to work on

### Step 3: Split up tasks
- For each of the 3 main tasks there will be a main developer and a secondary developer.
- Each task has its own develop branch which is only merged to main once the task is fully done
- Within the task there will be a number of feature branches, each one for a given subsection, to be merged to the develop branch after each          subsection is complete.
- Task List: 
    1. Task estimation in Scrum - Primary Author: Tami - Secondary Author: Thomas
    2. Coding Standards - Primary Author: Thomas - Secondary Author: Denisa
    3. Code Reviews - Primary Author: Denisa - Secondary Author: Tami
- [x] Main author for each section create develop branch the .md file and commit both to the main branch to show it is started
- [x] Secondary author add the header for each task into the .md file on a feature branch and commit it to the develop branch

### Step 4: Main body of each task
1 [x] Add a main heading and small description of what the task will entail

2 [ ] Add links to all articles that will be used as footnotes syntax

3 [ ] After the description of the task start by creating a feature branch for the sub-task and adding sub-headings for each article that will be described in the article

4 [ ] Under each subheading go through your thoughts on the article and what the author recommends

5 [ ] End each sub-section by giving a short list of the main learnings from the subsection

6 [ ] Repeat steps 3-5 for each of the sub-sections

7 [ ] After all subsections create a feature branch to close out the task, go through the overall main learnings from the task in bullet point version
