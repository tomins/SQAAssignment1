# Task Estimation in Scrum
## Primary Author - Tami Adeduntan
### Secondary Author - Thomas Cummins

### **Task Description**
In scrum projects, estimation is done by the entire team during sprint planning meeting. The objective of the estimation would be to consider the user stories for the sprint by priority and by the ability of the team to deliver during the time box of the sprint.

### Part 1: Scrum Estimation[^1]
#### Key Concepts
  - Scrum Techniques e.g Numeric Sizing, T-shirt Sizes, Fibonacci Sequence 
  - Planning Poker Technique
  - Benefits of Planning Poker Estimation

#### Details
##### What is the Poker Planning Technique?
- Estimates for the user stories are stemmed from playing planning poker
- The Fibonacci sequence is used and each cards has a number - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc
- Each number represents story points and each estimator has a deck of cards
- A team member is selected as the Moderator who reads the description of the user story
- The estimator privately selects a card that represents their estimate and the cards are not shown until all the estimators have made a selection
- All cards are then turned over and displayed so that all team members can see each estimate
- The high and low estimates are discussed and give their reason for estimating so while the moderator takes notes
- The process is repeated until the estimates merge to one estimate that will be used for the story

##### Benefits
- It combines three methods of estimation: Expert Opinion, Analogy and Disaggregation 
- Expert opinion involves asking an expert how long something will take
- Analogy compares user stories to similar ones created before
- Disaggregation involves splitting the user story into smaller stories that would be easier to estimate

#### Overview
Planning poker is a simple yet effecient method of estimating tasks in Scrum. It allows for a discussions to be made which means an agreement can be made by all team members.

### Part 2: The Challenges of Task Estimation[^2][^3]

While there are many benefits to estimating tasks in scrum, it can be quite challenging to accurately decide on an accurate estimation and may lead to incurrate estimations.

#### Factors
##### Pressure 
- There may be a lot of pressure on the team to complete the project and improve their performance. The pressure may be a result of outside sources such as management or external stakeholders. It may also be interal and pressure coming from the team itself or a particular person on the team. This pressure may lead to a team inflating story points which creates and illusion that the team can handle more or are doing more work than is actually being done. 

##### Uncertainties 
- A team member's uncertainities and insecurities can impact the team's judgement during estimation. For example, a team member could be new to the team and may feel uncomfortable or insecure and not know their place. This may lead to them inflating their estimation which would cover the worst possible scenario and may not actually be accurate to their abilities. As a result of this it impacts the overall amount of stories the team can have without being out of bounds of their limit. 

##### User Communication
- This may be a result of poor communication on the part of the customer. If a customer is not specific from the start as to what the specifics of what the project is and what it should entail, it could lead to issues later on as an estimation may end up being more difficult than the customer intially led on to believe.

#### Overview
There are many issues that may arise and interfere with task estimation. It is important to understand that by being aware of these problems, the team can understand how they make affect their estimation and try and avoid such from doing so. 

### Part 3: Improve Estimates [^4]
There are many tips that can be implemented to help a team improve their task estimation 
##### Everyone Estimate
- Task estimation is a very team orientated task, it is very important that everyoe estimates how long it will take them to do the work.
- Allows the team to properly discuss why each person thinks it will take that amount of time and decide on a middle ground
- Relying on one persons estimate can lead to inaccurate estimation as they may not be aware of the other members capabilties

##### Commitment
-   Estimate doesn't mean has to be required exactly in that amount of time
-   Is flexible and can be changed as a result of multiple factors
-   Mixing estimation and commitment may lead to inacurrate estimations out of fear of not completing it in the allocated time, can also cause low quality work

##### Skillful Estimation
- Decide on a limit for story point
- If a story is beyond the limit try breaking it down into smaller stories
- Discuss what everyone feels they can achieve in a certain amount of time

#### Overview
By applying these tips to improve estimates and make them more accurate, the team can achieve more success in the devlopment of their projects. 

### Part 4: Atlassian Story Points and Estimation [^5]
Task estimation is amoung the hardest jobs for a software development team. It takes into acccount a massive amount of factors and is constantly changing based on who is on the team and the priority of the project.


#### Factors
##### Estimation is a team sport
- Every member of a dev team brings a different perspective and set of skills, for a example a web developer might give a different estimation to that of a graphic designer. This is why its vital to involve everyone as there might be things that only some team members know enough abot to estimate properly.

##### Story Points vs Hours
- Hours of work and Story points are not the same thing. Story points includes many factors including the risk of the point, meaning there is a chance that implementing this item might break the code somewhere else.

##### Learn from past estimates
- Scrum retrospectives are a very important part of a scrum team as they allow us to learn from mistakes or things well done in previous scrum itterations allowing for more accurate estimation than in the past.

### Part 5: Medium How to estimate in Story Points
Estimation is best done on relative terms rather than literals because it cuts down on frustration and focuses on the problem.

#### Factors
##### Managers Perspective
- A product owner is dealing with customer demands as well as scrum team estimation so it is important for them to have a clear picture of how the project is developing from start to finish for the customer as well as what elements are the most difficult for the team to complete.

##### Fibonacci numbers
- The easiest way to estimate a task, eachof the numbers is the sum of the two before it. This helps as it shows the relativety f task difficulty.

##### Planning Poker
- The best way to have a team pick scrum eatimations. Give each of the team members a set of cards with fibonacci numbers on them and have them put one card down for each task. Have them keep a poker face while picking a card so as to ensure there is no bias in place. THis is made even easier now with zoom calls rather than in person meetings!
