### **Task Description**
In scrum projects, estimation is done by the entire team during sprint planning meeting. The objective of the estimation would be to consider the user stories for the sprint by priority and by the ability of the team to deliver during the time box of the sprint.

### Part 1: Scrum Estimation[^1]
#### Key Concepts
  - Scrum Techniques e.g Numeric Sizing, T-shirt Sizes, Fibonacci Sequence 
  - Planning Poker Technique
  - Benefits of Planning Poker Estimation

#### Details
##### What is the Poker Planning Technique?
- estimates for the user stories are stemmed from playing planning poker
- the Fibonacci sequence is used and each cards has a number - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc
- each number represents story points and each estimator has a deck of cards
- a team member is selected as the Moderator who reads the description of the user story
- the estimator privately selects a card that represents their estimate and the cards are not shown until all the estimators have made a selection
- all cards are then turned over and displayed so that all team members can see each estimate
- the high and low estimates are discussed and give their reason for estimating so while the moderator takes notes
- the process is repeated until the estimates merge to one estimate that will be used for the story

##### Benefits
- it combines three methods of estimation: Expert Opinion, Analogy and Disaggregation 
- expert opinion involves asking an expert how long something will take
- analogy compares user stories to similar ones created before
- disaggregation involves splitting the user story into smaller stories that would be easier to estimate

#### Overview
Planning poker is a simple yet effecient method of estimating tasks in Scrum. It allows for a discussions to be made which means an agreement can be made by all team members.
