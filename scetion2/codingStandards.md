### **Task Description**        
    Coding standards are a set of rules that guide developers to ensure their code is readable, safe, reliable, testable, maintainable and portable. This is vitally important as without it, a team of developers could create code that each of them cannot read, leading to massive amount of inefficiency and a high possibility of expensive mistakes that will take a long time to fix. Creating a robust set of rules and guidelines for a team to use will greatly increase current working standards and efficencies as well as future profing the project as any developer will be able to read the guidelines and understand the entire project and fix any issues much easier then before.

### Part 1: Geeks for Geeks coding standards and guidelines[^1]
#### **Key Concepts**
    - have a naming convention for all elements
    - indentation
    - document code well
    - shorten functions where possible
#### **Details**
    Coding standards are shown to be vitally important in an efficent team as they improve all elements of team development. Some of the rules that are important to take out of this article are as follows:
    - Limit global variables -- leads to more secure code
    - Standard headers for different modules -- name, date of creation, author, sysnopsis of the reason for the module
    - Naming convention for all elements -- Must be meaningful and easy to understand it's function, use camelCase
    - Indentation -- proper indentation allows for much easier reading of code and de-bugging
    - Error handling -- All error functions should return a 0 or 1 to simplify debugging
    - Documentation -- Well documented code is vital for future users of the code and for debugging
    - Short Functions -- Shorter functions allow for better code reusability and cut down on confusing logic
#### **Synopsis**
    This article introduces some very important concepts that will be used in our rules and regulations, there is a strong emphasis on proper structure which helps everyone around the project to be able to understand the code much easier. They also help to cut down time when debugging, hence reducing the cost of development significantly


### Part 2: Medium Coding standards and Conventions in Software Development Team[^2]
#### **Key Concepts**
    - Good standard naming
    - File naming and organization
    - Formatting and Documentation
    - Testing
#### **Details**
    Coding standards allow for many advantages such as easier team integration, increased code quality efficency and easier for maintaining, reduces code complexity & reducing code development. This means that disadvantages of not having well structured code standards include reduced engineers motivation, increased development team & complex codebase structure. Codong standards within an organization can be as detailed as needed, the more detail the better code quality, but the more complex for new users to understand so a balance is needed. Some of the key concepts that are discussed in this article include: 
        - Naming Conventions: how packages, classes, methods, variables etc. should be named in the same way (camelCase).
        - File and folder naming and organization: All files and folders should be formatted in the same manner.
        - Formatting and Indentation: Code should be formatted and indented as necessary to aid with debugging and general ease of understanding.
        - Commenting and Documentation: Makes code reviews and debugging much easier and faster.
        - Classes and Functions: Code should be broken up into appropriate classes and functions so as to aid ease of reading.
        - Testing: Code should be tested with appropriate tools to an approriate level.
#### **Synopsis**
    Overall, code standards are a vital part of any team coding enviroment as without them the process of coding would draw to a stop for a long time anytime there was an error or when a new team member was added.
