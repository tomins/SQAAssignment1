### **Task Description**        
    Coding standards are a set of rules that guide developers to ensure their code is readable, safe, reliable, testable, maintainable and portable. This is vitally important as without it, a team of developers could create code that each of them cannot read, leading to massive amount of inefficiency and a high possibility of expensive mistakes that will take a long time to fix. Creating a robust set of rules and guidelines for a team to use will greatly increase current working standards and efficencies as well as future profing the project as any developer will be able to read the guidelines and understand the entire project and fix any issues much easier then before.
