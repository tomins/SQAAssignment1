### **Task Description**        
    Coding standards are a set of rules that guide developers to ensure their code is readable, safe, reliable, testable, maintainable and portable. This is vitally important as without it, a team of developers could create code that each of them cannot read, leading to massive amount of inefficiency and a high possibility of expensive mistakes that will take a long time to fix. Creating a robust set of rules and guidelines for a team to use will greatly increase current working standards and efficencies as well as future profing the project as any developer will be able to read the guidelines and understand the entire project and fix any issues much easier then before.

### Part 1: Geeks for Geeks coding standards and guidelines[^1]
#### Key Concepts
    - have a naming convention for all elements
    - indentation
    - document code well
    - shorten functions where possible
#### Details
    Coding standards are shown to be vitally important in an efficent team as they improve all elements of team development. Some of the rules that are important to take out of this article are as follows:
     - Limit global variables -- leads to more secure code
     - Standard headers for different modules -- name, date of creation, author, sysnopsis of the reason for the module
     - Naming convention for all elements -- Must be meaningful and easy to understand it's function, use camelCase
     - Indentation -- proper indentation allows for much easier reading of code and de-bugging
     - Error handling -- All error functions should return a 0 or 1 to simplify debugging
     - Documentation -- Well documented code is vital for future users of the code and for debugging
     - Short Functions -- Shorter functions allow for better code reusability and cut down on confusing logic
#### Synopsis
    This article introduces some very important concepts that will be used in our rules and regulations, there is a strong emphasis on proper structure which helps everyone around the project to be able to understand the code much easier. They also help to cut down time when debugging, hence reducing the cost of development significantly
